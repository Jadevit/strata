Strata is a local-first AI platform built with Rust, Tauri, and React.  
It delivers fast inference, model management, and hardware-aware runtimes â€” without Electron bloat or external dependencies.

## Features
- Custom Rust inference loop with a handwritten FFI wrapper for `llama.cpp`
- GPU runtimes (CUDA, Vulkan, Metal) with automatic installer detection
- Multiple backend architecture (currently supports `llama.cpp`, designed for ONNX, Transformers, and more)
- Model manager with metadata scraping and dynamic prompt formatting
- Built-in benchmarking system with reproducible `.sbx` files
- Logging system for conversations and model runs
- CI/CD pipeline for cross-platform runtime publishing

## Installation
Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/jadevit/strata/releases).  
The installer detects your hardware and installs the correct runtime automatically.

## Roadmap
- Fine-tuning pipeline
- Additional backends (ONNX, Transformers, etc.)
- Remote inference with sandboxing and auditing
- Offline mode with strict security guardrails
